# GA Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

In this project we look into the aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States and perform data exploration and analysis. We attempt to identify trends in data and combine information extracted from external sources to support our reasoning on the findings that were derived from the exploration.

The overview of the project pipeline is as follows:
1. Data import and cleaning
2. Combine datasets from 2017 and 2018
3. Exploratory data analysis & Data Visualization
  - Distribution check
  - Check for participation rates
  - Check for relationships between SAT and ACT
  - Check for correlations between test subjects
  - Check for correlations between years
  - Overview of summary statistics for all variables
  
4. Conclusions and Recommendations
  - Based on analysis results, provide recommendation on how to increase SAT / ACT Participations
